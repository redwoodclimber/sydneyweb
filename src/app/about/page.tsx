I am currently in my final year at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts with a concentration in Stage Management. Fostering a safe & creative environment is my goal for every project I get to be a part of, as well as putting on a successful production. In my free time, I enjoy cooking as well as painting somewhat okay looking pictures. I am an avid music listener, and a loyal viewer of The Bachelor. I am currently looking for Stage / Production Management Positions in 2024 and Look forward to meeting you! </p>
